+ Test how the Array2D modification work with HeightMap and NormalMap

- Light Class is unfinished
	- Move stuff out of arena
	- Implement point light
	- Sparks generate point lights
- (optional) Z scale should affect graphics (normal are not re-oriented properly in lighting shader)
- Logger class (debug, info, warn, error, fatal) (console, file)
- Arena and Dyzk need a little cleaning up and re-factoring
- Move DyzkImageAnalizys to model
- Dyzk abilities
- Dyzx should collide with the arena, based on slope steepness
