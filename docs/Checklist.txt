+ Test how the Array2D modification work with HeightMap and NormalMap
+ Width, Height in the constructor of Arena should affect maps loading
+ Move DyzkImageAnalizys to model
+ Light Class is unfinished
	+ Move stuff out of arena
	+ Implement point light
	+ Sparks generate point lights
+ Dyzx should collide with the arena, based on slope steepness
- Logger class (debug, info, warn, error, fatal) (console, file)
- (optional) Separate the game model into a different thread to make its execution FPS independent
- ArenaLoader-s that loads an arena from multiple locations and feedback the progress
- (optional) scale should affect graphics (normals are re-oriented properly in lighting shader, point lights are affected by depth)
- Arena and Dyzk need a little cleaning up and re-factoring
- Remove hacks from Light and Dyzk (_refW)
- Dyzk abilities
