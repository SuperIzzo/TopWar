Spirits
---------------------------------
It is impossible to prevent client side hacks, and those include skill hacks. Skill hacks are essentially 
when the player uses software solutions to control their ingame avatar and appear more skilled than they really
are. For instance a skill hack in FPS may be a bot who always does a headshot.

In this game real skill will be hard to substitute (at least I hope so), but to make things more fair hacks will
be available to everyone in the form of AI support modules that will define various behaviours (and to flavor things 
up they will be called spirits). Spirits will have full information about the state of the game on the client machine
and they will be allowed to fire controller signals
