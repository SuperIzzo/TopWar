Go and read the thing in Colors.txt, this is the same basic idea refined a bit 
and made more colorful :)

Color can be useed for lots of cool stuff there is an image based rogramming language 
(it is called Piet). Tops are subjected to physics and are mostly controlled by physical 
forces, 

3x3 kernel
1. calculate avg intensity
2. from the 9 pixels pick the one with maximum
3. f = abs(avg - px) * randfactor * dot current direction
4. update current direction

This will essentially walk intensity shapes i.e. high contrast lines, useful for lines 
circles, curves etc... imagine the reader as a dot traversing the image, it will occasionally
chose random directions, when all intensities are the same it will take a random choice
but it will also be influence by its current direction.

If clors are in YUV space then Y would be the intensit it follows, U and V will provide
different function
