There are a lot of options to realize a multiplayer protocol
the current favourite is client-server 

Ideally players won't have to deal with setting up IP-s 

the protocol for establishing a connectoio


> Send a request to connect to a server
	(username and pass are sent)
> If approved retrieve a list of all lobbies on that server

Message protocols:

HANDSHAKE - 
	when a client sends the server a handshake the server replies with a HANDSHAKE message
	this is useful to test communication status
	
AUTH -
	ACTION: Sends authentication informantion to the server: (name and pass)
		the server replies with success or fail message
	INFO: Requests information about the authentication status on the server side
		the server replies with the success or fail based on the status and the
		authenticated name.

DYZK_INFO -
	ACTION: Sends dyzk information about a cleint/player to the server, 
		if in a battle lobby the server will automatically dispatch the information to
		othe players
	INFO: Request information about a dyzk a specific client/player has,
